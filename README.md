Android Dialog Creation Tutorial
============================

This repository is for my tutorial on how to [Create a Dialog](http://www.diusrex.com/2015/01/android-dialog-creation) in Android. 

I have an example implementation for onCreateView, onCreateDialog, and using both onCreateView and onCreateDialog.

Requirements to Run
============================

To run this project, you will need to have Android Studio to immediately run this project. To use Android Studio, you need to either have Android API 21 installed, or change the compiledSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion in app/build.gradle to an API version of your choice. It must be >= 14.

You can use Eclipse (or an other development tools for Android), but you may need to change the files organization.
